Rules and Probability Ratios\n
The rules follow normal chess except for the taking of pieces.\n\n
Each piece is assigned the standard number of points:\n
Pawn       1\n
Bishop     3\n
Knight     3\n
Rook       5\n
Queen      9\n
King       15\n\n
The probability of piece X taking piece Y is  (Points (X))/(Points (X)+ Points (Y)). \n\n
For example, the probability of a queen taking a pawn would be 9/(9+1) = 9/10.  The probability of a pawn taking a queen would be 1/(1+9) = 1/10.  The probability of any piece taking an opponent’s corresponding piece is 1/2.  \n\n
When the attacking player attempts to take a piece, a random probability generator determines whether or not he is successful in taking the piece.  The attacking player’s move finishes after attempting to take a piece, regardless of whether or not he is successful. Furthermore, the victory condition is not checkmate.  Rather, it is actually taking the king.  However, a player must still move his king when he is in check.  Therefore, to win, the attacking player must first checkmate the opposing king and then get lucky an actually take it.\n\n
